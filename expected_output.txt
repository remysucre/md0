`md0` is a format for hypertext documents. It is
designed to be easy to parse and render, and is a
proper subset of [markdown]. The main goal is to
make it easier to share text-based content online,
for authors, readers, and tool builders. The
original motivation is to create a format that can
be easily consumed by resource-constrained
devices. The following image shows this file
rendered on the [playdate] console:

![img]: md0 on playdate

If you are familiar with [gemtext], think of `md0`
as that but with support for inline links and also
happens to be valid markdown (so you can convert
it to different formats with existing tools).

`md0` consists of two simple extensions to plain
text: links and images, as follows:

- a **link ref** takes the form `[word][n]` where
`word` is a sequence of characters, none of which
is a space, an opening bracket `[`, or a closing
bracket `]`, and `n` is a positive integer
(non-zero). There must be a space between a link
ref and any preceeding text, while the space can
be omitted after the link ref. This is to support
cases like `this [link].` where punctuation
follows immediately after the link.
- a **link def** takes the form `[n]: link` where
`n` is a positive integer and `link` is a sequence
of non-space characters. Each link def must go on
its own line, and all link refs must come after
the main text content.
- an **image ref** takes the form `![alt text][n]`
where `alt text` is a sequence of characters, none
of which is an opening bracket `[`, or a closing
bracket `]`, and `n` is a positive integer. Link
defs for images take the same form as above. Every
image ref must be on its own line.

All other text is treated as plain text. This
document is a valid `md0` file despite the use of
**bold**, `code` syntax from full markdown - those
will simply be rendered verbatim.

Text is rendered line-by-line, and each line is
rendered word-by-word (words are delimited by
spaces), so consequtive spaces will be treated as
a single space (but consequtive lines will be
preserved). A link ref should be rendered in a way
to distinguish it from plain text. This includes
rendering it as-is (`[word][n]` already indicates
its is a link), as `word` with an underline, in a
different font, with a different background color,
etc.

A reference Python renderer implementation is
available in [`render.py`]. It renders `md0` text
with word wrapping at a maximum of 50 characters
per line and returns the rendered text along with
a dictionary mapping link numbers to their
positions.
